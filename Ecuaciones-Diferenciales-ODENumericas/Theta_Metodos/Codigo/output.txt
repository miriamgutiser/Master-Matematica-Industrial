***** DATA *****
* Initial (left) extremum: 
a = 0.00000E+00.

* Final (right) extremum: 
b = 5.00000E+00.

* Initial condition: 
eta = 1.00000E+00 

* Number of nodes of the mesh: 
N = 100. 

* Display frequency: 
dfreq = 10 (to avoid displaying too many lines, results are shown only for
the first node, the last node, and when node number is a multiple of dfreq).

* Plot frequency: 
plfreq = 2 (to avoid plotting too many points, results are plotted only for
the first node, the last node, and when node number is a multiple of plfreq).

* Option for exact solution: 
ex = 1 (the exact solution is known).>>> Theta Value:
    th = 0.5

>>> Convergence Method Option:
    option = 2 (Newton Method)

>>> Maximum Iterations:
    maxit = 20

>>> Epsilon Value for Stopping Criteria:
    epsi = 1.00E-14

>>> Delta Value for Stopping Criteria:
    delta = 1.00E-14
